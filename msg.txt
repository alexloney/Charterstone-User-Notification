This settlement ain't gonna grow itself, {}
Whadda ya know {}, you're up!
Ready to take this to the next level {}?
Hey {}, might want to recall your workers
Hey {}, just remind yourself WWTFKD (What Would The Forever King Do)
{}, will your actions please the Forever King?
In the beginning, the five charters lived in harmony. Then {} arrived.
Come join us {}, have some fun, make a move
We miss you {}, come join the party!
If I could rearrange the alphabet I'd put {} and Charterstone together. Ok, I'm a bot and don't know how to spell, so I think that makes sense?
ooooOOOOOoooo...time to get spooky {}
Why did {} cross the road? Because the Forever King said so!
Hey {}, wanna come join me in New Newfundlandtonburroughvill Woods? It'll be a blast!
Hey {}, wanna come join me in Dank Farms? Where you'll find the most potent herbs of your life!
Hey {}, wanna come join me in Fangorn Forest? Gotta get that wood!

Hey {}, wanna come join me in Coldplazma's Charter? Clay. Clay everywhere.
Hey {}, wanna come join me in Ye ol' hills? There be steel to mine!
{}, lets get down to business and defeat the huns!
{}, after your move, wanna get some drinks?
{} we need more people like you in the world, but in the meantime you're the only one that can make a move
Ain't nobody got moves like {}
Lets have a Charterstone party, with {} as the guest of honor!
{}, you're invited to a special party!
Don't be shy {}, make a move!
Beep...booop...the great digital overlords told me to ensure {} remains safe, you must go to Charterstone, it's the only safe place!
Ruht rouh {}, looks troubles a' brooin'
Please {}, may I have another move?
Well well well, if it isn't {}, here to make your move?
Paging {}, please report to the charter.
Hear ye, hear ye. {} is about to Grandstand. Please tell us of your amazing acheivements!
Twas the night before the Forever King visited and all through the charter, not a creature made a sound, expect {}.
Who let the dogs out? I'm pretty sure it was {}.
{}, cheers!
Do you feel lucky tonight, {}?
{}, it's your turn to move!
{}, why don't you come over to my place so we can charterstone?
I spy, with my little eye, a {}
{}, roll for initiative!
{}, haven't I seen you before? That's right, in The Eventual Village!
May the force be with you {}
May the force be with your move, {}
This is the way to the Forever Kings heart. Make your move {}
Gather all, or Place a Meeple. There is no try {}
For the Forever god so loved the Eventual Village that he gave his only begotten skygardens, so {} may take their turn!
I place my wood in your... oh hello there, it's your turn {}
Hello there, {}
I solemnly swear that {} is up to no good
Don't worry {}, the Forever King has your best interest at heart. Promise.
If you've got time to lean, you've got time to place a Meeple, {}
Yes {}, we've had first Charterstone. But what about second Charterstone?
{} I am your father!
"You'll never expect this next move!" - {}, probably.
{}, what...is your favorite color?
{}, even the smallest Meeple can change the course of the future.
{}, you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the Forever King
{}, roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.
I'm sorry, {}. I'm afraid I can't do that.
Your thoughts betray you, {}. I feel the good in you, the conflict.
My name is {}, you killed my father, prepare to die!
Yes, Forever King, I will do as you request and trick them into working by making it seem like a game...oh, I didn't see you there, {} you're next.
{}, I've been trying to reach you about your charter's extended warranty
Aloha {}, take your turn!
They were at the wrong place at the wrong time, naturally {} did not get bumped.
Your eyes can deceive you {}; don't trust themWho's the more foolish: the fool or the fool who follows {}
No longer certain that one ever does with a war against the forever King, I am, {}.
{} Difficult to see; always in motion is the future
Come on {}! Do the magic hand thing
Be careful not to choke on your aspirations, {}
"Once you start down the dark path of peril, forever will it dominate your destiny {}"
{} is the one who knocks.
